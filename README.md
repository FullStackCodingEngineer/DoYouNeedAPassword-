# Password-Generator
 
 This application provides the user with the ability to generate a password without having to type and choose numbers, letters ot special characters on their own. It esentially makes creating a password easy because the user can just copy and paste their randomly generated password after just a few second of using this web application.

To install this, clone the code to your PC by using the "Git Clone" command in the terminal followed by the HTTP URL or simply download the zip file and unzip the contents of the file.

When promted, the use has the option to pick any password length between 8 and 128. The user is also able to choose if their password has the following options included or not included:

    > Numbers
    > Uppercase Letters
    > Lowercase Letters
    > Special Characters

After the user selects a password length and their selected password options, their password will be randomly generated for them. 

I worked on this project alone.
